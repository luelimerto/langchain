Plaxis 3D Foundation 2.2 is an older version of the software that was released in 2007. It has some features and capabilities that make it a powerful tool for geotechnical engineering, such as:
 
- A user-friendly interface that guides the user to efficiently create a geometry, generate a finite element mesh, execute a finite element calculation and evaluate the output results.
- A comprehensive library of soil and rock models that can simulate different types of soil and rock behaviour, such as linear elasticity, Mohr-Coulomb, Hardening Soil, Soft Soil Creep, Jointed Rock, and more.
- A variety of structural elements that can be used to model different types of structures, such as beams, plates, piles, anchors, geotextiles, and more.
- A range of loading conditions that can be applied to the model, such as gravity, prescribed displacements, forces, moments, pressures, temperatures, and more.
- A powerful post-processing tool that allows the user to visualize and analyse the results of the calculation, such as displacements, stresses, strains, forces, moments, safety factors, and more.

Plaxis 3D Foundation 2.2 also provides some tutorials and examples that help the user to learn how to use the software and apply it to different types of problems. For instance, one of the tutorials shows how to model the settlement of a foundation in overconsolidated clay[^1^]. Another example shows how to use the designing tools in Structures mode to design a shaft foundation with reinforcements[^2^].
 
However, Plaxis 3D Foundation 2.2 is not the latest version of the software and it may have some limitations or drawbacks compared to the newer versions. For example, Plaxis 3D Foundation 2.2 does not support dynamic analysis or groundwater flow analysis. It also does not have some advanced soil models or structural elements that are available in the newer versions. Therefore, it is recommended to use the latest version of Plaxis 3D Foundation if possible.
 
The latest version of Plaxis 3D Foundation is V20.0[^3^], which was released in December 2020. It has some new features and improvements that make it more efficient and versatile for geotechnical engineering applications. Some of these features are:
