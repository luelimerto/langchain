## How to Use Vnc Scanner Gui V1.2?
 
To use Vnc Scanner Gui V1.2, you need to download it from a reliable source[^1^] [^3^] and unzip it to a folder on your computer. Then, you can run the executable file (VNC Scanner GUI v1.2.exe) and follow these steps:
 
1. Enter the IP range you want to scan in the "IP Range" field. You can enter a single IP address (e.g., 192.168.0.1), or a range of IP addresses separated by a dash (e.g., 192.168.0.1-192.168.0.255). You can also import IP addresses from a TXT file by clicking on the "Import" button and selecting the file.
2. Enter the port you want to scan in the "Port" field. You can enter a single port number (e.g., 5900), or a range of port numbers separated by a dash (e.g., 5900-5910). You can also scan multiple ports by separating them with commas (e.g., 5900,5901,5902).
3. Click on the "Start Scan" button to start scanning the IP range and port(s). The program will display the results in the table below, showing the IP address, port number, status (open or closed), country, and response time.
4. You can export the results to a TXT file by clicking on the "Export" button and choosing a file name and location.
5. You can also get IP ranges by country by clicking on the "Get diap list" button and selecting a country from the drop-down menu. The program will load the IP ranges for that country in the "IP Range" field.

## What Can You Do With the Results?
