If you have a Toyota car with a Japanese original DVD player model NDDN-W58, you may encounter a problem when you unplug the battery terminal. The DVD player may show a message that says "Please insert correct map disc" and stop working. This is because the DVD player needs a map disc software to run properly. Without the map disc software, you will not be able to enjoy music, back camera, FM radio, or AUX input.
 
Fortunately, there is a solution for this problem. You can download the NDDN-W58 map disc software from online sources and burn it to a CD or DVD. Then, you can insert the CD or DVD into the DVD player and wait for the map loading message to appear. After a few minutes, the map will show your vehicle as a blinking marker and the DVD player will function normally.

1. Download the NDDN-W58 map disc software from [this link](https://navigationdiskjp.com/product/nddn-w58-2/) [^2^] or [this link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3jzq7y0x8k0wv7x/NDDN-W58.rar?dl=0) [^4^]. You may need to pay a small fee to get the software.

3. Insert the CD or DVD into the DVD player of your car. The screen will go blank and display "map loading" with a Garmin logo.
4. Wait for about 180 seconds until the map shows your vehicle as a blinking marker. You may see a message that says "GPS engine not found" - press any key to abort. This is normal and does not affect the functionality of the DVD player.
5. Enjoy your music, back camera, FM radio, and AUX input on your NDDN-W58 Toyota DVD player.

The NDDN-W58 map disc software is compatible with Toyota cars that have the NDDN-W58 DVD player model. This model is usually found in Toyota cars that are imported from Japan, such as Camry, Corolla, Prius, Vitz, and others. The NDDN-W58 DVD player has a 7-inch touch screen display that can show maps, music, videos, and other features.
 
The map disc software is necessary for the DVD player to work properly. The map disc software contains the data and instructions that the DVD player needs to operate. Without the map disc software, the DVD player will not be able to read the discs or the USB devices that you insert. It will also not be able to connect to the GPS system or the back camera of your car.
 
The map disc software is usually stored in a memory chip inside the DVD player. However, when you unplug the battery terminal of your car, the memory chip may lose its data and become corrupted. This is why the DVD player will show the "Please insert correct map disc" error message when you turn it on again. To fix this error, you need to insert a CD or DVD that has the map disc software burned on it. The CD or DVD will overwrite the corrupted data on the memory chip and restore the functionality of the DVD player.
