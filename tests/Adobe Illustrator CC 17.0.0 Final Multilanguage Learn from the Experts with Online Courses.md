# What's New in Adobe Illustrator CC 17.0.0 Final Multilanguage?
 
Adobe Illustrator CC 17.0.0 Final Multilanguage is the latest version of the popular vector graphics software that lets you create stunning logos, icons, illustrations, and more. This version comes with many new features and improvements that make your design process easier and faster. Here are some of the highlights:
 
- **Touch Type tool**: This tool allows you to manipulate individual characters as if they were objects. You can move, scale, rotate, and change the font or style of any character without affecting the rest of the text. You can also use multitouch devices to edit your text with gestures.
- **Images in brushes**: You can now use raster images as brushes in Illustrator. You can create Art, Pattern, and Scatter brushes with images and apply them to your strokes. This opens up new possibilities for creating organic and complex designs with ease.
- **Font search**: Finding the perfect font for your project is now easier than ever. You can type a style, a font family, or any part of a font name in the Character panel and get a filtered view of the fonts that match your criteria. You can also sync fonts from Adobe Typekit and have them available for use in Illustrator.
- **Multiple-file place**: You can now import multiple files into your Illustrator document at once and control their location and scale. You can also preview how each file will look on your artboard before placing it.
- **CSS extraction**: If you are working on web design projects, you will love this feature. Illustrator can now generate CSS code for your web elements, such as icons and patterns, and copy it to your clipboard. You can then paste it into your web editor and save time on hand-coding.
- **Sync Colors**: You can capture color themes from the real world with the Adobe Kuler iPhone app and sync them to Illustrator. You can also explore thousands of color themes on the Kuler website and use them in your designs.
- **Area and point type conversion**: You can now switch between area type and point type instantly without losing your text formatting. You can also convert imported text objects to either type with a single click.
- **Auto corners for pattern brushes**: Creating pattern brushes with sharp corners is now easier than ever. Illustrator automatically generates corners that match the rest of the stroke, so you don't have to create them manually.
- **On-art Free Transform**: You can now transform objects directly on the artboard using a touchscreen device or a mouse. You can move, scale, and rotate objects with more precision and intuitiveness.
- **Behance Integration**: You can now save your work directly from Illustrator to Behance, the leading online platform for creative professionals. You can showcase your finished projects or share your work in progress with other designers and get feedback.
