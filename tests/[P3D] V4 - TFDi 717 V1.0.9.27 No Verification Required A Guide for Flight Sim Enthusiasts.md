## TFDi 717 Review: A Modern and Realistic Add-on for P3D V4
 
The TFDi 717 is not just a simple port of an old aircraft to a new simulator. It is a fully updated and improved add-on that takes advantage of the latest features and technologies of P3D V4. In this review, we will take a closer look at some of the aspects that make the TFDi 717 a great choice for P3D V4 users.
 
### Performance and Optimization
 
One of the main concerns of P3D V4 users is the performance and optimization of their simulator. The TFDi 717 is designed to run smoothly and efficiently on most systems, without compromising on quality and realism. The add-on uses dynamic texture loading, which means that only the textures that are needed are loaded into the memory, saving resources and improving loading times. The add-on also uses dynamic lighting, which creates realistic shadows and reflections on the aircraft and the environment. The TFDi 717 also supports PBR (Physically Based Rendering), which adds more depth and realism to the materials and surfaces of the aircraft.

### True Glass and Real Light
 
The TFDi 717 includes two exclusive technologies that enhance the immersion and realism of the add-on: True Glass and Real Light. True Glass simulates realistic rain and ice effects on the windshield, which react to the weather conditions and the aircraft speed. The windshield wipers can also be used to clear the rain or ice from the glass. Real Light simulates realistic cockpit lighting, which can be adjusted and dimmed according to the time of day and the preference of the pilot. The cockpit lighting also affects the displays and instruments, creating a natural and dynamic look.
 
### SmartCopilot
 
The TFDi 717 also features SmartCopilot, a technology that allows two pilots to fly the same aircraft online, sharing controls, systems, and displays. This creates a realistic and fun shared cockpit experience, where pilots can cooperate and communicate with each other. SmartCopilot also allows pilots to fly with other users who have different versions of P3D or FSX, as long as they have the same version of the TFDi 717 installed.
 
### Conclusion
 
The TFDi 717 is a modern and realistic add-on for P3D V4 that offers a lot of features and options for different types of users. Whether you are looking for a casual or a hardcore simulation experience, you will find something to enjoy in the TFDi 717. The add-on is well-designed, well-optimized, and well-supported by the developers, who are constantly updating and improving it. The TFDi 717 is definitely worth checking out if you are looking for a new aircraft to fly in P3D V4.
