# Review: Advanced C Programming by Example by John W. Perry
 
If you are an intermediate-level C programmer who wants to take your skills to the next level, you might want to check out this book by John W. Perry. Published in 1998, this book covers various advanced topics in C programming, such as dynamic data structures, string parsing and numeric conversion, memory management, bit-level manipulation, interactions with operating systems, and more.

What sets this book apart from traditional data structures books is its "blue collar" approach to the art of programming Ã¢Â€Â” how to master the "down in the trenches" C details to implement abstract ideas successfully. In recognition of this approach, the book presents actual C code rather than pseudocode. The code examples are clear, concise, and well-commented, and they illustrate the practical use of the concepts discussed in each chapter.
 
The book consists of 51 chapters, each focusing on a specific topic or problem. The chapters are organized into six parts: Part I introduces some basic concepts and tools for advanced C programming; Part II covers dynamic data structures such as linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs; Part III deals with string processing techniques such as scanning, parsing, searching, and sorting; Part IV explores numeric data types and conversions, including binary, octal, hexadecimal, and floating-point representations; Part V explains memory management issues such as allocation, deallocation, garbage collection, and memory leaks; and Part VI demonstrates how to interact with operating systems using system calls, signals, pipes, sockets, and file I/O.
 
The book assumes that the reader has a solid background in C programming and is familiar with the ANSI C libraries. It also requires some knowledge of basic data structures and algorithms. The book is not intended for beginners or experts, but for those who want to improve their C programming skills and learn some new techniques along the way.
 
Overall, this book is a valuable resource for anyone who wants to learn advanced C programming by example. It is well-written, well-organized, and well-illustrated with code examples. It covers a wide range of topics that are relevant and useful for real-world applications. It is also a great reference book for C programmers who need a quick reminder or a deeper explanation of some advanced concepts.
