The Laguna was the successor of the Renault 21, which had been in production since 1986. The first generation of the Laguna was available in two body styles: a five-door hatchback and a five-door estate. It had a range of petrol and diesel engines, and offered various features such as anti-lock brakes, airbags, and climate control. The Laguna was well received by critics and customers alike, and won several awards for its design and safety. The first generation of the Laguna was produced until 2001, when it was replaced by the second generation. The second generation of the Laguna introduced a major innovation: it was the first European car to have a keyless entry and ignition system, which allowed the driver to start the engine with a card instead of a key.
  
The second generation of the Laguna was also available in two body styles: a hatchback and an estate. It had a more modern and elegant design than the first generation, and offered more space and comfort for the passengers. The second generation of the Laguna also had a wider range of engines, including a 3.0-litre V6 petrol engine and a 2.2-litre dCi diesel engine. The second generation of the Laguna was praised for its refinement and reliability, and was one of the best-selling cars in its segment in Europe.

In 2007, Renault introduced the third generation of the Laguna, which had a completely new design and platform. The third generation of the Laguna was only available as a hatchback or a coupÃ©, as the estate version was replaced by the Renault Megane Sport Tourer. The third generation of the Laguna had a more dynamic and sporty look than the previous generations, and featured new technologies such as adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning, and bi-xenon headlights. The third generation of the Laguna also had a new range of engines, including a 2.0-litre turbocharged petrol engine and a 3.5-litre V6 petrol engine. The third generation of the Laguna was well received by critics, but did not achieve the same sales success as the previous generations.

In 2015, Renault discontinued the Laguna nameplate and replaced it with the Renault Talisman, a new mid-sized car that was designed to compete with premium models such as the BMW 3 Series and the Mercedes-Benz C-Class. The Talisman was based on a new modular platform shared with other Renault-Nissan models, and had a sleek and sophisticated design. The Talisman was also available in two body styles: a saloon and an estate. The Talisman had a high level of equipment and quality, and offered several advanced features such as four-wheel steering, active damping, and a digital instrument cluster. The Talisman was well regarded by critics and customers alike, and won several awards for its design and innovation.
