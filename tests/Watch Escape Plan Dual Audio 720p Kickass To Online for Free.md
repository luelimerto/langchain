If you want to use Fusion Lifecycle for free, you might be tempted to look for a keygen or a crack that can bypass the software's activation process. However, this is not a good idea for several reasons. First of all, using a keygen or a crack is illegal and unethical, as it violates Autodesk's terms of service and intellectual property rights. Second, using a keygen or a crack can expose your computer to malware, viruses, or ransomware that can harm your system or steal your data. Third, using a keygen or a crack can compromise the security and reliability of your product data, as you might lose access to the cloud service or face legal consequences.
 
Therefore, the best way to use Fusion Lifecycle is to purchase a legitimate license from Autodesk or an authorized reseller. You can choose from different subscription plans that suit your needs and budget. You can also try Fusion Lifecycle for free for 30 days by signing up for a trial account on Autodesk's website. By doing so, you can enjoy the full benefits of Fusion Lifecycle without risking your computer or your product data.

## What are the features and benefits of Fusion Lifecycle?
 
Fusion Lifecycle is a cloud-based product lifecycle management (PLM) software that offers a range of features and benefits for product development teams. Some of the main features and benefits are:
 
- New product introduction (NPI): Fusion Lifecycle helps you manage your product development process from concept to launch, with configurable project templates, phase-gate milestones, tasks, deliverables, and dashboards[^1^] [^2^]. You can also integrate Fusion Lifecycle with other tools such as CAD, CAM, and CAE software for seamless data exchange and collaboration.
- Bill of materials (BOM) management: Fusion Lifecycle enables you to centrally manage and share structured BOMs throughout your enterprise, ensuring that everyone is working with the most up-to-date and accurate information[^1^] [^2^]. You can also visualize your BOMs in different views, such as engineering, manufacturing, or service, and compare different versions for changes.
- Change management: Fusion Lifecycle allows you to submit, track, and approve change requests and change orders, with automated workflows, notifications, and approvals[^1^] [^2^]. You can also link change records to related items such as BOMs, documents, or quality issues for traceability and impact analysis.
- Quality management: Fusion Lifecycle helps you prevent and resolve quality issues, with automated quality workflows such as corrective and preventive actions (CAPA), nonconformance reports (NCR), failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA), and audits[^1^] [^2^]. You can also track and record quality changes, assign responsibilities, and analyze quality metrics to identify trends and root causes.
- Supplier collaboration: Fusion Lifecycle enables you to stay connected with your global supply chain 24/7, with information for quoting, procurement, and supplier management[^1^] [^2^]. You can also share BOMs, documents, specifications, and feedback with your suppliers securely and efficiently.

Fusion Lifecycle is part of Autodesk's Fusion 360 suite, which also includes CAD, CAM, and CAE software. Fusion Lifecycle is built on the same underlying technology as Fusion 360 Manage Extension\*, a new offering in development that will extend PLM capabilities to an even broader set of CAD products[^1^]. Fusion Lifecycle is rebranded from Fusion 360 Manage to reflect this common platform[^1^].
 
Fusion Lifecycle is accessible anytime, anywhere from a browser, providing instant-on PLM that frees you up from expensive consulting and IT overhead[^1^] [^2^] [^3^]. It comes with core PLM apps and dozens of specialized processes at no extra cost. Rather than starting from scratch, each app includes out-of-the-box workflows that you simply tailor to your needs. You can also integrate Fusion Lifecycle with other business systems such as ERP, CRM, or PDM using its open API[^1^] [^2^] [^3^].
 
By using Fusion Lifecycle, you can improve collaboration and design reuse, track revisions, reduce errors, boost productivity, streamline workflows, automate tasks, access timely information, enhance quality, optimize resources, reduce costs, accelerate time to market, and bring better products to market faster[^1^] [^2^] [^3^] [^4^].
