- **A unified design environment:** Isplever Classic 15 provides a single graphical user interface (GUI) that integrates all the tools and functions needed for FPGA design. You can easily access the schematic editor, HDL editor, synthesis tool, simulator, timing analyzer, floorplanner, place and route tool, device programmer, and documentation generator from the same window. You can also switch between different views and modes of your design without losing your work.
- **A flexible design entry:** Isplever Classic 15 supports both schematic-based and HDL-based design entry methods. You can use the schematic editor to create your design using graphical symbols and wires. You can also use the HDL editor to write your design using Verilog or VHDL languages. You can even mix both methods in the same project and use the cross-probing feature to navigate between the schematic and HDL views of your design.
- **A powerful synthesis tool:** Isplever Classic 15 includes the Synplify Pro synthesis tool from Synopsys, which is one of the industry-leading synthesis tools for FPGA design. Synplify Pro can optimize your design for speed, area, power, or a combination of these factors. It can also perform advanced optimizations such as retiming, resource sharing, pipelining, logic replication, constant propagation, and more. Synplify Pro can generate netlists in EDIF or NGD formats for further processing by other tools.
- **A fast and accurate simulator:** Isplever Classic 15 includes the Aldec Active-HDL simulator, which is a high-performance mixed-language simulator for FPGA design. Active-HDL can simulate your design at different levels of abstraction: behavioral, RTL (register transfer level), gate-level, or post-layout. It can also perform functional verification, timing analysis, code coverage analysis, debugging, and waveform generation. Active-HDL supports Verilog and VHDL languages as well as mixed-language simulation.
- **A comprehensive timing analyzer:** Isplever Classic 15 includes the Lattice Diamond Timing Analyzer (LDTA), which is a dedicated timing analysis tool for Lattice FPGA devices. LDTA can perform static timing analysis (STA) and dynamic timing analysis (DTA) on your design. It can also generate timing reports and constraints files for other tools. LDTA can help you identify and resolve timing issues in your design before programming your device.
- **A smart floorplanner:** Isplever Classic 15 includes the Lattice Diamond Floorplanner (LDFA), which is a graphical tool that allows you to view and edit the physical layout of your design on your target device. LDFA can help you optimize your design for performance, power consumption, 8cf37b1e13
