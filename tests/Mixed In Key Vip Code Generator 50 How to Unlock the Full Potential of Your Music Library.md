1. Turn off your printer and unplug it from the power source.
2. Remove any paper or cartridges from your printer.
3. Open the scanner unit and locate the screws that hold the printer cover. Unscrew them and remove the cover carefully.
4. Locate the ink pads at the bottom of the printer. They are usually covered by a plastic shield. Remove the shield and pull out the ink pads with tweezers. Be careful not to spill any ink on yourself or your surroundings.
5. Cut the new ink pads to fit the size and shape of the old ones. Insert them into the slots where the old ones were. Replace the plastic shield and secure it with screws.
6. Connect the waste ink tank to the printer using a tube. You can either drill a hole in the back of the printer or use an existing hole to pass the tube through. Make sure the tube is long enough to reach the waste ink tank and that it is not kinked or blocked.
7. Place the waste ink tank in a safe and stable location where it won't spill or overflow. You can either hang it on a wall or place it on a flat surface.
8. Replace the printer cover and screw it back in place. Close the scanner unit and plug in your printer.
9. Reset your waste ink counter with WIC Reset Utility as described in the previous section.

Congratulations! You have successfully replaced the ink pads in your Epson Px660 printer with a waste ink tank. You can now use your printer normally without any errors. However, you should check the waste ink tank regularly and empty it when it is full. You should also clean your printer periodically to prevent any clogging or damage.
