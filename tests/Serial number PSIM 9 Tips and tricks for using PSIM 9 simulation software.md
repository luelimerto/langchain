## Step 5: Explore PSIM 9 Features
 
PSIM 9 is not just a simple simulation software. It has many features and modules that can help you with various aspects of power electronics and electric drives design and analysis. Some of the features and modules that you can explore are:
 
- **Renewable Energy Package:** This package includes solar cell models, wind turbine model, and maximum power point tracking (MPPT) examples. You can use this package to simulate and optimize renewable energy systems such as photovoltaic (PV) arrays, wind farms, and hybrid systems[^3^].
- **Support to Texas Instruments DSP F28335:** PSIM 9 can generate C code that can run on the Texas Instruments DSP F28335 microcontroller. This microcontroller is specially designed for power electronics and motor control applications. You can use PSIM 9 to design, simulate, and implement your control algorithms on this microcontroller[^3^].
- **Temperature effect in Thermal Module calculation:** PSIM 9 can take into account the temperature effect on the power devices and components in the Thermal Module calculation. This can improve the accuracy and reliability of the thermal analysis and design of power converters[^3^].
- **New calculation functions in Simview:** PSIM 9 has added new calculation functions in Simview, the waveform viewer of PSIM. You can use these functions to perform various calculations on the simulation results, such as RMS value, average value, peak value, frequency, phase angle, harmonic distortion, etc[^3^].
- **64-bit version:** PSIM 9 has a 64-bit version that can handle larger and more complex simulations. The 64-bit version can utilize more memory and CPU resources than the 32-bit version, and thus improve the simulation speed and performance[^3^].
- **New and improved MagCoupler and MagCoupler-RT blocks:** PSIM 9 has improved the MagCoupler and MagCoupler-RT blocks, which are used to couple PSIM with finite element analysis (FEA) software such as JMAG or ANSYS Maxwell. The new blocks can support multiple FEA models in one simulation, and can also handle nonlinear magnetic materials[^3^].
- **Control loop design software SmartCtrl, and integration with PSIM:** PSIM 9 has integrated with SmartCtrl, a control loop design software developed by Powersimtech Inc. SmartCtrl can help you design and optimize control loops for power converters using various methods such as root locus, Bode plot, Nyquist plot, etc. You can export your control loop design from SmartCtrl to PSIM for simulation and verification[^3^].
